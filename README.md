# 🥦 Evaluating Nutritional Density of Foods to Enhance Dietary Health and Well-Being

A data-driven project to assess the **nutritional density of foods** with the goal of empowering healthier dietary decisions and improving overall well-being.

This repository contains code and analysis that evaluate food nutritional values and helps users compare foods based on their nutrient density and nutritional quality.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses nutritional data to:

* Calculate food **nutrient density scores**
* Compare foods based on key nutrients
* Provide **dietary insights** to promote healthier eating habits

Nutrient density reflects how much nutrition a food delivers **relative to its energy content**, helping identify foods that deliver substantial nutrients for fewer calories. ([PubMed][1])

---

## 🧠 Why Nutritional Density Matters

Choosing nutrient-dense foods is vital for improving diet quality and overall health because:

✔ Foods with **high nutrient density** deliver more essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber per calorie
✔ Helps users make **informed dietary choices**
✔ Supports education in nutrition and public health

Nutrition rating systems and nutrient density indexes are widely used in dietary research to help people select foods with the most beneficial nutritional profiles. ([Wikipedia][2])

## 🛠️ Installation

> **Prerequisites:** Python 3.7+ and basic skills using Jupyter or Python scripts.

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rashmi-Gupta26/Evaluating-Nutritional-Density-of-Foods-to-Enhance-Dietary-Health-and-Well-Being.git
   cd Evaluating-Nutritional-Density-of-Foods-to-Enhance-Dietary-Health-and-Well-Being
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Notebooks**
   Open notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the analysis.

---

## 📊 Example Usage

> These are example steps — replace with your actual notebook or script usage.

```bash
# Run a Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook
```

In the Notebook, you might:

* Load food nutrient data
* Compute density scores
* Visualize top high-nutrient foods
* Compare results with dietary guidelines

## 🧪 How Nutrient Density is Evaluated

Nutrient density models typically score foods by comparing essential nutrients relative to energy content. For example, tools like the **NRF9.3 index** rank foods based on beneficial nutrients (e.g., fiber, vitamins) minus limiting nutrients (e.g., saturated fat, sugar). ([PubMed][1])
